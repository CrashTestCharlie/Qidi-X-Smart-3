# Camera Mount

While Qidi sells a camera, using a better camera makes for a better
result.

## The Mount

The mount is a printed base and lid that mounts on the right front
upright of the X-Smart 3 using existing mounting holes.

### Tools needed

- Heatset tool (soldering iron with heatset tips, or equivalent)
- 3mm hex wrench
- 2.5mm hex wrench
- Other screwdrivers as needed. (The only 2.5mm screws I could source
locally were slotted drive.)

### Parts required

- Webcam module, [ASIN xxx](https://a.co/xxxx)
- The printed mount, [STL here](camera-mount.stl)
- 2x 2.5 x 4 mm heatset inserts
- 2x 3 x 6 mm heatset inserts
- 2x M3 x 8mm screws
- 2x M2.5 x 6mm screws

## Instructions

Installing the mount does involve removal of the right side plastic. Be
careful with the plastic tabs that lock it all together.

- Install the heatset inserts into the camera mount base. The M2.5
  inserts are for the front lid and the M3 inserts are for the mounting
  holes on the rear. For the lid, only two are needed, installing four
  is optional.
- Remove the six screws holding the right side cover.
- Gently pull the cover away from the housing starting at the bottom
  front.
- Remove the top black plastic ring that holds the top clear cover. Lift
  up on it starting from the front right corner and work your way
  around.
- Remove three screws that hold the front plastic to the frame near the
  front right upright.
- Gently pry the front cover away from the frame to expose the mounting
  holes.
- Position the mount so the top of the mount (with the cable exit) is in
  the corner of the front right upright and level with the top of the
  upright.
- Install the M3 screws to secure the mount to the upright.
- Lay the printer on its side and remove the bottom cover.
- Route the camera USB cable from the electronics bay up the right front
  upright. Follow the screen cable through the hole in the bottom
  corner. Make sure the camera connector reaches the top of the upright
  with some slack.
- Connect the USB cable to an open port on the mainboard. Secure the
  extra in the same area as the external port cable.
- Re-install the bottom cover and set the printer upright.
- Connect the cable to the camera module.
- Position the camera module into the mount base with the connector
  aligned with the cutout.
- Attach the camera mount lid with two M2.5 screws.
- Reattach the front cover with three screws.
- Reinstall the top ring.
- Reinstall the right side cover with six screws.
